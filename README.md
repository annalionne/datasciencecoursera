# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
The code in here was prepared for the Getting and Cleaning course project on Coursera.
## Data Source
The data source is: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 
## Tasks
The script does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
