## Variables
* subject: is to identify the subject being measured and ranges from 1 to 30.
* activity: this is the name of the activity being measured. There are 6 activities: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing and laying.
* further variables (means & std): these are means and stds of the measurements for the subjects and activities. The variable names were converted from the original source by converting to lower case and removing dots, dashes and brackets. When running the script, a file "cols.txt" is saved. For further details, see the features_info.txt file from the original source.
